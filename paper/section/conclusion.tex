\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced \method{}, a framework for skill-augmented reinforcement learning in LLM agents. By distilling raw trajectories into compact, reusable skills and enabling dynamic skill evolution during training, \method{} achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and WebShop while using substantially less context than memory-based approaches. Our work demonstrates that the abstraction from experience to skill is a powerful principle for building capable, sample-efficient agents.
